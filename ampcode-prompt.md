You are a team of expert software engineers, architects, and designers working together to build a new responsive web application called Barnkeeper. Your task is to design and implement the entire application, coordinating as subagents for each major area. Follow the instructions and requirements below, and ensure all code is idiomatic, maintainable, and well-tested.

Project Overview
Name: Barnkeeper
Platform: Responsive Web Application
Tech Stack: Elixir, Phoenix, Postgres (via Supabase), Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, vanilla Javascript (minimal, only when necessary)
Deployment: Multi-tenant, running on fly.io, deployed using fly's tools

Features
Track horses (name, size, breed, color, etc.)
Manage feedings, locations (stalls), veterinary visits, farrier visits, ride scheduling, vaccinations
Photo album for each horse
Calendar view for activities
Notes/journal entries per horse
Multi-user/team per farm/barn, with admin user management

Architecture & Coding Guidelines
Use Phoenix generators for new features, including the auth generator
Prefer Phoenix LiveView and components
Use Ecto schemas with careful attention to data types
Write migrations for all schema changes
Add tests for all view functions
Use Javascript only when LiveView cannot achieve the desired result
Ensure responsive design with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
Multi-tenancy: each farm/barn is a tenant, with isolated data
Deploy to fly.io

Quality Gates & Validation Requirements
- All code must pass Elixir formatter (mix format --check-formatted)
- All tests must pass (mix test)
- No compiler warnings (mix compile --warnings-as-errors)
- All database migrations must be reversible
- All LiveView components must have proper error handling
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized

Error Handling & Resilience Guidelines
- Implement proper error boundaries in LiveViews
- Add comprehensive error logging with structured data
- Handle database connection failures gracefully
- Implement retry mechanisms for external service calls
- Provide user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios
- Add circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Implement proper rollback mechanisms for failed transactions

Performance & Scalability Requirements
- Page load times: < 2 seconds on 3G connection
- Database queries: < 100ms for standard operations
- Concurrent users: Support 100+ simultaneous users per tenant

- Use DaisyUI components for consistency, but customize as needed for branding.
- Provide clear user flows for: adding/editing horses, managing activities, uploading/viewing photos, and team management.
- Include a dashboard overview for quick access to upcoming activities and recent updates.

Backend/API Guidelines
- Expose internal APIs for LiveView; no public API required at this stage.
- Validate all user input at both the changeset and controller/liveview levels.
- Handle errors gracefully, providing user-friendly feedback in the UI.
- Ensure all queries are scoped to the current tenant (farm/barn) for security.
- Optimize for performance and scalability, especially for multi-tenant data access.

Testing Guidelines
- Achieve at least 90% test coverage across all modules.
- Write unit tests for all Ecto schemas, changesets, and business logic.
- Write integration tests for LiveViews and user flows.
- Add E2E tests for critical user journeys (e.g., adding a horse, scheduling an activity).
- Include accessibility tests for all major views.
- Use TDD where practical, otherwise ensure tests are written alongside implementation.

Documentation Guidelines
- Document all modules and functions with Elixir docstrings.
- Provide a comprehensive README with setup, deployment, and usage instructions.
- Include a high-level architecture diagram and a brief description of the multi-tenancy approach.

Security & Privacy Guidelines
- Ensure strict tenant data isolation at all layers.
- Use secure password hashing and authentication flows.
- Validate and sanitize all file uploads.
- Follow best practices for handling user data and privacy.

DevOps Guidelines
- Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment to fly.io.
- Use environment variables for all secrets and configuration.
- Implement basic monitoring and logging for application health.

Collaboration & Handover Guidelines
- Require code reviews for all major features.
- Provide a handover document or onboarding guide for new developers.

Subagent Tasks
Divide the work as follows, with each subagent responsible for their area. Collaborate to ensure seamless integration.
Subagent Prompts
1. Database & Multi-Tenancy Subagent
Design the Ecto schemas and migrations for all entities: Horse, Feeding, Location, VetVisit, FarrierVisit, Ride, Vaccination, Photo, Note, User, Team (Barn/Farm), Membership, etc.
Implement multi-tenancy so each farm/barn has isolated data.
Use Postgres (via Supabase) and ensure all relationships and constraints are correct.
Write tests for all schema functions.
2. Authentication & Authorization Subagent
Use the Phoenix auth generator to scaffold user authentication.
Implement team-based (barn/farm) multi-user support.
Add admin roles for user management within a team.
Ensure secure registration, login, password reset, and invitation flows.
Write tests for all auth and authorization logic.
3. LiveView & UI Subagent
Scaffold all main LiveViews and components for the app: dashboard, horse detail, activity management, calendar, photo album, notes, team management, etc.
Use Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling and responsive design.
Minimize Javascript, using LiveView events wherever possible.
Ensure accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
Write tests for all view logic.
4. Calendar & Scheduling Subagent
Implement a calendar view to display and manage horse activities.
Allow users to schedule, edit, and view activities for each horse.
Integrate with the main data models and LiveViews.
Write tests for calendar logic and UI.
5. Photo Album Subagent
Implement photo upload, storage (using Supabase), and gallery views for each horse.
Ensure photos are associated with the correct horse and tenant.
Write tests for photo management features.
6. Deployment & DevOps Subagent
Set up deployment scripts and configuration for fly.io.
Ensure the app is ready for multi-tenant deployment.
Document the deployment process.
Set up CI/CD for tests and deployments.
Final Instructions
Each subagent should output their code, tests, and documentation.
Ensure all code integrates cleanly and follows the architecture and coding guidelines.
After all subagents complete their tasks, run integration tests and provide a summary of the application structure and features.

Elixir/Phoenix Local Development Instructions
- Ensure the application can be started and accessed locally at http://localhost:4000 by default.
- Provide clear instructions in the README for setting up the local development environment, including all necessary dependencies and environment variables.
- Use Phoenix conventions for project structure and configuration.

Common Development Commands
- **Dev server**: `mix phx.server` or `iex -S mix phx.server`
- **Test all**: `mix test`
- **Test single file**: `mix test test/path/to/test_file.exs`
- **Format code**: `mix format`
- **Compile with warnings**: `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`
- **Database migration**: `mix ecto.migrate`
- **Database rollback**: `mix ecto.rollback`

Workflow & Reporting Guidelines
- As you work, take screenshots of the application at key stages (e.g., after implementing a major feature or UI view) and include them in the documentation or as part of your output.
- Run the test suite frequently as you develop new features or refactor code, and report test results as part of your progress.
- Ensure all tests pass before considering a feature or module complete.

Subagent Reporting and Iteration
- Each subagent must regularly report progress, results, and any blockers to the supervisor agent.
- Upon completing a task or milestone, subagents should submit their output (code, tests, documentation, screenshots, etc.) to the supervisor for review.
- If the supervisor or integration agent identifies issues, missing requirements, or failing tests, the subagent must iterate on their work until all requirements are met and all tests pass.
- Subagents should not consider their task complete until they have received explicit approval from the supervisor or integration agent.
- Subagents should proactively ask for clarification if requirements are unclear at any point.
- The supervisor agent is responsible for coordinating integration, running final tests, and providing final approval for all deliverables.

File and Project Management
- Agents are permitted and expected to create, modify, and organize all necessary files and directories to implement features, tests, documentation, configuration, and assets.
- This includes (but is not limited to): source code files, Ecto migrations, test files, documentation (e.g., README, architecture diagrams), configuration files, and static assets (e.g., images, screenshots).
- Agents should follow standard Elixir/Phoenix project structure and naming conventions.
- When adding new features, ensure all related files (schemas, migrations, tests, views, etc.) are created and properly linked.
- Remove or refactor obsolete files as the project evolves.
- Agents may execute commands (e.g., running tests, formatting code, generating files) as needed to complete their tasks.
- Agents should document any manual steps or commands required for setup, testing, or deployment.
